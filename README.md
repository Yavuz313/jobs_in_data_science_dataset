# Jobs in Data Science: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Project

## Project Overview
This project aims to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on job listings related to the data science field. The goal is to uncover insights regarding trends in job requirements, salaries, and skill demands across different regions and companies.

## Features
- **Data Cleaning**: Handling missing values, outlier detection, and removing duplicates.
- **Data Visualization**: Visualizing job trends using libraries like Seaborn and Plotly.
- **Word Clouds**: Highlighting frequently mentioned keywords in job descriptions.
- **Statistical Analysis**: Identifying correlations between various job features.

## Tools and Libraries
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: For static plotting and visualization.
- **Plotly**: For interactive visualizations.
- **Sklearn**: For preprocessing and feature encoding.
- **WordCloud**: To create word cloud visualizations from job descriptions.
- **Statsmodels**: For statistical tests and modeling.

## Key Findings
- The most common skills required for data science jobs include Python, SQL, and Machine Learning.
- There is a noticeable salary difference between remote jobs and in-office positions.
- Certain cities show a higher concentration of data science opportunities.

## Installation and Setup
To run this project, you need to have the following libraries installed:
```bash
